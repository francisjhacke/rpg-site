## Prompt

I want to create a website called me RPG. The premise is that users will be asked questions 1 at a time to enter in rpg-like stats: weight/height/diet to represent health, common exercises/body to weight ratio to represent strength, education to represent intelligence, age to represent experience points, age/life events to represent wisdom, and others

From there, I want to display an avatar unique to the combination of answers provided (could just be some randomly seeded algo).

Finally, the app will provide actionable steps to improve the statistics calculated in each area of their life. On the users birthday, they will get a surge of experience which they can use to put points into the areas that they feel they have improved or enjoyed best in the last year.

There should also be other avenues to earn experience each day. Small mini-games such as quizzes, or a check-list for the day for easily achievable goals to help them strive towards the areas they most want to improve. They can mark items off as they see fit and gain small amounts of experience points
